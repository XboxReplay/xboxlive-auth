        **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention!**

        It looks like you are encountering the following error when using `@xboxreplay/xboxlive-auth`:

        ```
        XboxReplayError: Could not match "PPFT" parameter
        ```

        **Important:** This error is **not caused by this library directly**. It usually happens when using an outdated version or due to changes in Microsoft's authentication flow.

        **Do NOT open an issue in this repository for this error.** Instead:

        1. Verify that you are using a supported version of `@xboxreplay/xboxlive-auth`:
           - Either you are directly using version **>= 5.1.0**
           - Or the library you are using (e.g., `prismarine-auth`) depends on **@xboxreplay/xboxlive-auth >= 5.1.0**
        2. If the error persists while using a supported version, please **proceed to open an issue** on the official repository.

        Following this will help keep this repository focused on genuine bugs related to the current library version.  

        Thank you for your understanding! üôè
